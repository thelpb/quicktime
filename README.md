# QuickTime
An SPT AKI mod which provides a simple facility to quickly change the time in-game.

This was built and briefly tested with the 26535 client and SPT AKI 3.7.6. It should work with the client as setup under any 3.7.x release though.

I am not a developer so I apologize in advance for this.

## Configuration
Configure a keybind via the BEPINEX F12 menu, . (period) by default. There are no other configuration options.

While in raid, hold the configured keybind and use the mouse scroll wheel to set the time. Only the hour is adjusted, no change will be made to the in-game minute or second.

This has no impact on the raid / extraction timer.

## How to install
1. Download the latest release from the SPT AKI hub -OR- build from source.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file `thelpb.quicktime` into your root SPT-AKI directory near `EscapeFromTarkov.exe`.
3. Inside `BepInEx/plugins` folder you should see `thelpb.quicktime.dll`

Thank you to everyone on the SPT AKI Discord, doubly so to the dev team and mods, and to BSG for making this game in the first place.
